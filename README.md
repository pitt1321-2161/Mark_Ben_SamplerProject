# Mark_Ben_SamplerProject
Ben Kerestan, Mark Lederer final project 

Goal (rough draft): Create a program to take in the first 4 measures (~30 secs each) of ~8 .wav files, using an appropriate sample rate and width, break the samples down into their respective notes as they would correspond to notes on the standard MIDI keyboard, and take a note randomly from one of the eight files corresponding to the successive note in Beethoven's Fur Elise, and rewrite the note to a new .wav file. The effect is a note for note sampler playing this popular melody. To improve the sound quality of the sample, another program will be written to take in each note in the melody and find it's corresponding note in harmony. The harmony will be used in the final .wav file as deemed appropriate after listening to the unharmonized melody.
